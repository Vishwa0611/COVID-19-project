# COVID-19 India Analysis 📊

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of **COVID-19 cases in India** using data-driven methods. It includes state-wise data exploration through **Jupyter Notebook** (using Python and pandas) and insightful **interactive visualizations using Tableau**.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to analyze the COVID-19 pandemic's impact across various Indian states. It involves:

- Cleaning and analyzing real-time state-wise COVID-19 data
- Exploring trends in active cases, discharged patients, and deaths
- Creating interactive Tableau dashboards to visually represent key metrics

## 📁 Datasets Used

### 🧪 Jupyter Notebook (Python)
Two datasets are used for analysis in the notebook:
1. **State-wise COVID-19 data**
2. **Vaccination status (optional/secondary dataset)**

The notebook includes:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Descriptive statistics and EDA
- Correlation and ratio analysis
- Insights and interpretations

### 📊 Tableau Dashboard
A third dataset was used specifically in **Tableau** to create an interactive dashboard.

#### Dataset Details:
- **Date**: September 12, 2023
- **Attributes**:
  - `State/UTs`: Names of Indian States and Union Territories
  - `Total Cases`, `Active`, `Discharged`, `Deaths`
  - `Active Ratio (%)`, `Discharge Ratio (%)`, `Death Ratio (%)`
  - `Population`

This dataset is ideal for **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**.
